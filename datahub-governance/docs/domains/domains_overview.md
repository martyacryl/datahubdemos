# Domains Overview

Domains in DataHub are organizational constructs that help you logically group related assets together based on business units, teams, or subject areas.

## Key Characteristics

- **Hierarchical Organization**: Domains can have parent-child relationships

- **Ownership**: Domains have owners who are responsible for the assets within them
- **Access Control**: Domains can be used for access management

## Domain Structure

A domain typically consists of:

- **Name**: A unique identifier for the domain
- **Description**: A clear explanation of what the domain represents
- **Owners**: People or groups responsible for the domain
- **Assets**: Datasets, dashboards, pipelines, etc. that belong to the domain
- **Sub-domains**: Child domains that represent sub-categories
