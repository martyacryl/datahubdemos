# Bridging Financial Services Data and Governance: Snowflake + DataHub Integration

Excited to share our latest integration that combines Snowflake's Financial Services Asset Management capabilities with DataHub's powerful data governance platform! ðŸš€

Financial institutions need both powerful data processing AND robust governance. With this integration, we're showcasing how you can:

âœ… Create a Single Version of Truth (SVOT) for trading positions and P&L
âœ… Track complete data lineage from source to final reports
âœ… Maintain governance with domains, glossary terms, and data quality metrics
âœ… Discover financial data assets across your organization

The code is now available on GitHub, complete with setup scripts and documentation. Perfect timing before #SnowflakeDataSummit! 

This integration demonstrates Snowflake's power for financial services workloads while adding the governance layer that regulators and business users need.
