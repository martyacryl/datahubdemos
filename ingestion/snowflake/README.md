# DataHub Snowflake Integration

This repository contains tools, examples, and best practices for integrating Snowflake with DataHub, a metadata management platform for modern data stacks.

## Overview

DataHub provides a comprehensive metadata management platform for your data ecosystem. Integrating Snowflake with DataHub allows you to:

- **Catalog Snowflake Assets** - Automatically ingest metadata for databases, schemas, tables, views, and more
- **Track Lineage** - Visualize how data flows through your Snowflake environment
- **Monitor Usage** - Understand how users are interacting with your Snowflake data
- **Enable Governance** - Apply tags, ownership, and domains to Snowflake assets
- **Improve Discovery** - Make Snowflake data assets searchable and discoverable

## Comparison with Other Solutions

| Feature | DataHub + Snowflake | Snowflake Native | Other Metadata Tools |
|---------|---------------------|------------------|------------------------|
| Metadata Extraction | Comprehensive (tables, views, schemas, usage) | Limited | Varies by tool |
| Lineage Tracking | Table and Column level | Limited | Varies by tool |
| Custom Metadata | Tags, Glossary Terms, Domains | Tags only | Varies by tool |
| Search Capabilities | Advanced | Basic | Varies by tool |
| Cross-Platform Integration | Yes (100+ connectors) | Limited | Varies by tool |
| Open Source | Yes | No | Varies by tool |
| Enterprise Features | Available | Available | Varies by tool |

## Use Cases

1. **Data Governance and Compliance**
   - Track sensitive data with automatic classification
   - Apply access policies based on metadata
   - Document data sources and transformations

2. **Data Discovery and Self-Service**
   - Enable analysts to find relevant Snowflake datasets
   - Understand data structure and relationships
   - Find subject matter experts for specific datasets

3. **Data Quality Management**
   - Monitor data quality metrics over time
   - Set up alerts for data quality issues
   - Track impact of quality issues across downstream assets

4. **Data Operations**
   - Visualize pipeline dependencies
   - Understand impact of schema changes
   - Monitor usage patterns for optimization
