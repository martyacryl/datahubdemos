    description: |
      The calculated market value of a bond position adjusted for business factors including

      Formula: PAR_VALUE * (1 + COUPON_RATE/100) * MATURITY_MULTIPLIER * RISK_FACTOR.
      The maturity multiplier reflects time value for bonds approaching maturity, and the risk 
      factor adjusts for credit risk premiums. This adjusted value is used for all position 
      reporting and analytics.
